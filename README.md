# RetroViz
We make Retro Vintage Art using p5.js (John Whitney Inspired). Read [more](https://www.iamwilliamj.com/projects/2020-11-07-p5jsRetroViz.html)

# Use
If you want to reuse the code - copy paste the sketch.js and paste it into the p5.js web editor - (it should work).
Alternatively just fork this repo.
Feel free to give me a shout out if you're going to publish any work derived from here!

Cheers,
William

Have a good day everyone!
